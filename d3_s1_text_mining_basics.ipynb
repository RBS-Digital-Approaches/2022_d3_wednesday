Like stemming, lemmatization removes the inflectional forms of words. While it tends to be \n","more conservative in its approach, it is better at avoiding lexical merges like \"complicated\" and \"complicity\" \n","becoming \"complic.\" More, the result of lemmatization is always a fully readable word, so no need to worry about \n","trying to remember what \"malleabl\" means. If, say, you want to know something about the _theme_ or _topicality_ of \n","a text, lemmatization would be a valuable step.\n","\n","#### Part-of-speech tags and dependency parsing\n","\n","Lemmatizers can do all this because they use the context provided by **part-of-speech tags** (POS tags). To get the \n","best results, you need to pipe in a tag for each word, which the lemmatizer will use to make its decisions. In \n","principle, this is easy enough to do. There are software libraries, including `nltk`, that will automatically \n","assign POS tags through a process called **dependency parsing**. This proces analyzes the grammatical structure of \n","a text string and tags words accordingly.\n","\n","But now for the catch: to work at their best, _dependency parsers require both stop words and some punctuation \n","marks_. Because of this, if you know you want to lemmatize your text, you're going to have to tag your text before \n","doing other steps in the text cleaning process. Further, it's better to let an automatic tokenizer handle which \n","pieces of punctuation to leave in and which ones to leave out. You'll still need to remove everything later on, but \n","only after the dependency parser has done its work. The revised text cleaning steps would look like this:\n","\n","1. Tokenize\n","2. Assign POS tags\n","3. Resolve word casing\n","4. Remove punctuation\n","5. Remove numbers\n","6. Remove extra whitespaces\n","7. Remove stopwords\n","8.

To wit: the processes above would dissolve \"New York\" into \n","two separate tokens, and it would be very difficult to know how to reattach \"new\" and \"york\" from something like \n","raw count metrics -- we may not even know this entity exists in the first place. Chunking, on the other hand, would \n","lead us to identify it.\n","\n","In this sense, it's often useful to count not only single words in our text, but continuous two word strings, even \n","three. We call these strings **n-grams**, where _n_ is the number of tokens with which we chunk. \"Bigrams\" are \n","two-token chunks. \"Trigrams\" are three-token chunks.
